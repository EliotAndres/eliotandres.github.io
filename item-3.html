		<h3>The project</h3>
		<p>
			Getting to a great user experience takes time: a seven-week project like Pop Valet gave us plenty of time to try, fail and iterate. The main purpose of the app is to give you access to premium valets : trusting the service was extremely important.
		</p>
		<h3>The stack</h3>
		<p>
			Although I did't mess a lot with it, sails was used for the back. Administration is done using ng-admin. For the front, along with the classic Ionic + Angular, we also used a native map plugin [Link] to avoid reloading maps.</p>
		<h3>Screens</h3>
