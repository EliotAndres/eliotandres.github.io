		<em>Quality art tips // 2 weeks</em>
		<h3>The project</h3>
		<p>
			Although we always work with hybrid technology, Artips was the exception. The client came to us with a native codebase (iOS and Android) and asked us to interface a webview with his app. When you open the app, the content you see is in a webview. But when you tap a 'special edition', it opens a native view.
		</p>
		<h3>The stack</h3>
		<p>
			Along with the usual Ionic + Angular we always use, we took advantage of the cordova payment plugin [LINK]. We also made our own plugin to interface with the native views. As for the back, our needs were very simple, so we used Firebase.
