		<em>School Project // Innovation award // Mobile App + Hardware Sensor</em>
		<h3>The project</h3>
		<p>
			One of the school laboratory is developing cutting edge polution sensors and was struggling to find a usage for it. We were asked to develop a complete set of technology to put them to good use. Using Design Thinking and the classic process of inspiration, ideation, iteration, we proposed an integrated solution to monitor the pollution levels in your everyday life.

		<h3>The stack</h3>
		<p>
			Along with the usual Ionic + Angular we always use, we took advantage of the cordova payment plugin [LINK]. We also made our own plugin to interface with the native views. As for the back, our needs were very simple, so we used Firebase.
